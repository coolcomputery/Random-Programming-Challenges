# Random-Programming-Challenges
This is a collection of random programming challenges I might update from time to time.

## 1. Range Sum Query but the array gets too big

Say that we have an array and a file with some non-negative integers, one integer per line.

The array starts with all elements set to 0.

For each number in the file, treat it as an index for the array and increment the element there by 1.

A second file will have several lines with two non-negative integers per line.

**For each pair of integers (a,b), output the sum of the elements in the array with index between a and b, inclusive.**

All numbers in both files are between 0 and 10^100. Each file will have up to 10^5 lines. The time limit is 2 seconds.


later challenges coming soon...
