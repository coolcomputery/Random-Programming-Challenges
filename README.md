# Random-Programming-Challenges
This is a collection of random programming challenges I might update from time to time.

## 1. Range Sum Query but it's weird

Say that we have an empty list and a file with some lines of integers. Each line has either 1 or 2 integers.

If there is 1 number, add it to the list. Include duplicate numbers if they come up.

If there are two numbers, then output how many values in the list are between these two numbers, inclusive, in another file.

All numbers in the input file are between 0 and 10^100. The file will have up to 100,000 lines. The time limit is 2 seconds.


later challenges coming soon...
