# Random-Programming-Challenges
This is a collection of random programming challenges I might update from time to time.

## 1. Range Sum Query but it's weird

Say that we have an empty set and a file with some lines of integers. Each line has either 1 or 2 integers.

If there is 1 number, add it to the set. Include duplicate numbers if they come up.

If there are two numbers, then output in another file how many elements in the set are between these two numbers, inclusive.

All numbers in the input file are between 0 and 10^100. The file will have up to 100,000 lines. The time limit is 2 seconds.


later challenges coming soon...
